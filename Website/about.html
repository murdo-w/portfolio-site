          <p>Throughout my life I've enjoyed art and technology. From as far back as I can remember, I was doing something creative, whether it be drawing traditionally, or on a computer, to playing with Lego. When applying to college, I wanted to do something that involved being artistic, while being technical. I ended up in a HND class for Digital Art and Culture. This was an excellent course, it taught me the process to design something from beggining to end, from book covers to websites, but the process can be applied to almost anything. This course also introduced me to programming, which I greatly enjoyed. We created small programmes using Processing, a programming language designed for visual arts, but it is now deprecated and being replaced by the p5.js JavaScript library. Which can run directly on a webpage.</p>

          <h3>What I Do</h3>
          <p>I like to create art in a wide range of mediums, from painting traditionally to creating programmes to draw something for me.</p>
          <p>Right now I'm getting more into programming with Java, and practicing my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills by creating this website.</p>
